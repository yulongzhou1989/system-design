Scalability: service more users

	1. Vertical scaling
		- 
	2. Horizontal scaling 
		-- more machine (throwing money), multiple servers
		-- load balancer - public ip
				other servers - private ips
				-busy/unbusy server / functional / 
				round dropping (BIND)
					G:simple implement
					B:not balance/caching issue
				session - store in the same server
				RAID 0 - 2 identical hard drives - strip data - 2 times speed G:performance
				RAID 1 - mirror data - G: robust
				RAID 10 - 4 drives
				RAID 5 - 1 drive redundency, 
				RAID 6 - any drive can die, and have copy
			Implement:
				Software:
					ELB, HAProxy, LVS..
				Hardware:
					Cisco, Critix F5, Barracuda
			Sticky session: multiple time, with same backend server
